Life expectancy:
https://www.worlddata.info/life-expectancy.php
In the years 1960 to 2021, life expectancy has increased perceptibly worldwide. Starting at 50.7 years, it increased for men by 18.1 years to 68.9 years. For women, life expectancy increased by 19.3 years from 54.6 up to an average of 73.9 years since 1960.

Women tend to live longer than men. In 2021, this difference amounted to a 5-year gap in global life expectancy: the average life expectancy was 73.8 years for women versus 68.4 years for men.

At baseline, women were on average 74.7 (standard deviation [SD] 2.3) years old (Table 1). Average ages at menarche and menopause (natural or surgical) were 12.8 (SD 1.4; range 9-17) and 49.0 (SD 6.4; range 30-60) years, respectively. Women had a mean of 36.1 (SD 6.5; range 13-51) reproductive years. Reproductive lifespan was highly correlated with age at menopause (r=0.98; p<0.001) but weakly correlated with age at menarche (r=−0.19; p<0.001).
