Further Presentation information:
  - The 10-minute time limit for presentations is strict, points will be deducted if you take longer.

Discussants have to pay attention to their corresponding presentation, as the student projects will not be available before the presentations.

We have not set a limit on the number of pages of reports but we trust that you will try to be concise. Please do not include redundant output or notebook code, your report has to be readable and well-edited.

A good practice is to structure your presentation with at least one slide for each part of the report, so it is easier to follow.

You will learn the date when your project presents and when it iss discussant on the week after groups are registered. Prepare as if you would present on the first session.
